```
<pre>Conway Life</pre>
```

Conway Life but it's rendered inside just one `pre` element, another one for background. Try inspecting them [here](http://conway-life.vercel.app/).

Rendering to text is basically done by combining braille characters
so this could even work inside a terminal with the right font settings to look good.

I'll add braille combination logic later but feel free to look at source.
